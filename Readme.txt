Here you'll find the Roguelike project

You can move the hero around to reach the exit

The exit is always located at the furthest reachable room

This was created from pieces of code found online (reuse) as well as some original.  
Monsters and treasure could be easily generated by adding extra digits to the matrix
(ie. treasure could be 6 and monsters could be 7).  Teleporters could also be added to reach
the unreachable rooms.  Thought about adding monsters with a timer to automatically move around
the map.

		//0 = empty (void) space
		//1 = room tile
		//2 = wall
		//3 = entrance
		//4 = exit
		//5 = hero

		

Overall time: ~5 hours
